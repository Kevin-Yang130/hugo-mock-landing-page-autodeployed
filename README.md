## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yaml`. The workflow:

- Automatically builds the Hugo site
- Deploys the generated static content to GitHub Pages
- Is triggered on every push to the `main` branch

The deployment uses the [`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) action to handle publishing. This removes the need for manual deployments and ensures the site stays up to date with every commit.
